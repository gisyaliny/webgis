        "# WCAG 2.1 AA — Developer Checklist \n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is a **developer-oriented guide** to implement and audit WCAG 2.1 AA in modern web apps (HTML/CSS/JS; SPA frameworks; data-heavy UIs).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "## 1) Overview — What is WCAG 2.1 AA?\n",
        "**WCAG 2.1** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) provides criteria to make the web accessible to people with disabilities. It is structured by the **POUR** principles:\n",
        "- **Perceivable**: information must be presented in ways users can perceive (text alternatives, captions, sufficient contrast).\n",
        "- **Operable**: all UI must be keyboard-operable; provide visible focus; avoid traps.\n",
        "- **Understandable**: clear labels/instructions; consistent behavior; predictable navigation.\n",
        "- **Robust**: compatible with assistive technologies; use semantic HTML and valid markup.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Levels**: A (basic), **AA** (required under ADA Title II web rule), AAA (enhanced).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "## 2) Detailed Developer Checklist\n",
        "\n",
        "### A. General Structure / Semantic HTML\n",
        "- Use semantic landmarks: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`.\n",
        "- One `<h1>` per page/view; subsequent headings (`<h2>`–`<h6>`) in logical order.\n",
        "- Prefer native HTML semantics before ARIA.\n",
        "- Ensure a unique, descriptive `<title>` for each page/route.\n",
        "\n",
        "### B. Text Alternatives & Media\n",
        "- **Images**: Meaningful `alt` text; decorative images use `alt=\"\"`. Avoid images of text (logos OK).\n",
        "- **Charts/Maps**: Provide data tables or textual summaries; for maps, include an accessible list of locations.\n",
        "- **Audio/Video**: Captions for video; transcripts for audio-only; audio description when visuals convey meaning.\n",
        "- **Icons/SVG**: Provide accessible names (e.g., `aria-label`) if no visible text.\n",
        "\n",
        "### C. Color & Contrast\n",
        "- Minimum contrast: 4.5:1 (normal text), 3:1 (large text ≥ 18pt or 14pt bold).\n",
        "- Don’t rely on color alone for meaning—add text/icons.\n",
        "- Keep focus indicators highly visible (`:focus`, `:focus-visible`).\n",
        "- Do not disable OS/browser high-contrast modes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### D. Keyboard Accessibility\n",
        "- All functionality available via keyboard (no mouse required).\n",
        "- Logical tab order matches visual order; no keyboard traps.\n",
        "- Provide a **Skip to main content** link.\n",
        "- **Modals**: trap focus while open; restore focus to trigger when closed.\n",
        "- **Menus/Dropdowns**: support arrow keys; `Esc` closes.\n",
        "- Custom controls replicate native behavior using roles/`tabindex`/`aria-*` only as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### E. Forms & Inputs\n",
        "- Every input has a visible `<label>` programmatically associated (via `for`/`id` or wrapping label).\n",
        "- Mark required fields in text (not color alone).\n",
        "- Clear, specific error messages; associate with fields using `aria-describedby`.\n",
        "- Group related controls with `<fieldset>`/`<legend>` where appropriate.\n",
        "- On submit errors, move focus to the first invalid field.\n",
        "\n",
        "### F. Dynamic Content / JavaScript / SPAs\n",
        "- Announce dynamic updates with ARIA live regions (`aria-live=\"polite\"`).\n",
        "- Maintain sensible focus when injecting or replacing content.\n",
        "- Avoid auto-refresh/auto-redirect; provide user control.\n",
        "- Provide time extension where timeouts exist.\n",
        "- Use ARIA sparingly and correctly; prefer semantic HTML.\n",
        "- Custom widgets (tabs, sliders, modals): add proper roles & keyboard support; update `document.title` and move focus on route changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### G. Navigation & Orientation\n",
        "- Consistent navigation and placement across pages.\n",
        "- Use logical heading structure; no skipping levels.\n",
        "- Ensure responsive layouts preserve reading order.\n",
        "- Declare language on `<html lang=\"...\">`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### H. Timing / Animations / Motion\n",
        "- No flashing content > 3 times per second.\n",
        "- Provide pause/stop controls for carousels/auto-playing media.\n",
        "- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` to limit motion effects.\n",
        "- Warn before session timeout; allow extension.\n",
        "\n",
        "### I. Documents & Downloads\n",
        "- Make PDFs accessible (tagged, logical reading order) or provide equivalent HTML/text.\n",
        "- Use descriptive link text (e.g., “Download flood report (PDF)”).\n",
        "\n",
        "### J. Error Prevention & Feedback\n",
        "- Confirm destructive actions or provide undo.\n",
        "- Provide top-of-form error summary for long forms.\n",
        "- Do not rely on color alone to indicate errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### K. Mobile & Touch\n",
        "- Proper viewport meta; content reflows without horizontal scrolling.\n",
        "- Touch targets ≥ 44×44 CSS px.\n",
        "- Don’t require gesture-only interactions; provide clickable alternatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "### L. Testing & Verification\n",
        "**Automated checks**: axe (ext/CLI), Lighthouse Accessibility, WAVE, Accessibility Insights.\n",
        "**Manual checks**: keyboard-only navigation; NVDA/VoiceOver screen reader passes; color-contrast tests; 200% zoom test; responsive/orientation tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "## 3) Implementation Notes for JS/SPA Apps\n",
        "- On route change, update `document.title` and move focus to the main heading or content container.\n",
        "- Provide an offscreen ARIA live region for announcing updates.\n",
        "- Ensure modals/menus/popovers manage focus correctly.\n",
        "- For virtualized lists/tables, expose semantics and counts (e.g., `role=\"table\"`, `aria-rowcount`).\n",
        "- For interactive maps/charts, include accessible summaries, keyboard interactions, and data tables as alternatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "## 4) Workflow Integration (CI/CD)\n",
        "- **Design**: include focus order and color-contrast checks in design reviews.\n",
        "- **Development**: semantic-first; ARIA minimal; keyboard paths implemented.\n",
        "- **Testing**: run automated checks per PR; monthly manual AT testing.\n",
        "- **Deployment**: publish accessibility statement and contact for feedback.\n",
        "- **Maintenance**: schedule periodic audits; fix regressions promptly.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "## 5) Quick Reference — Top 15 to Remember\n",

        "2. Headings are hierarchical and meaningful.\n",
        "3. Every form input has a proper label.\n",
        "4. All features are keyboard accessible.\n",
        "5. Focus is always visible.\n",
        "6. Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (3:1 for large text).\n",
        "7. Don’t use color alone to convey meaning.\n",

        "### Bonus: Simple ARIA Live Example\n",
        "```html\n",
        "<div id=\"sr-updates\" aria-live=\"polite\" class=\"sr-only\"></div>\n",
        "```\n",
        "```js\n",
        "document.getElementById('sr-updates').textContent = 'Loaded Flood Risk Report section';\n",
