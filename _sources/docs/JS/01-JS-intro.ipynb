    "## Variable declare\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript, you can introduce variables using various keywords such as `var`, `let`, and `const`\n",
    "\n",
    "### `var`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Function Scoped`: Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped. This means that they are accessible throughout the function in which they are declared, regardless of block scope.\n",
    "- `Hoisting`: Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their function or global scope. This means **you can access the variable before it's declared without causing an error**, although its value will be `undefined`.\n",
    "- `Re-assignable`: You can reassign values to variables declared with `var`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `let`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Block Scoped`: Variables declared with `let` are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are defined in (e.g., within loops, conditionals, or functions).\n",
    "- `No Hoisting`: Unlike `var`, variables declared with `let` are not hoisted to the top of their scope. They are only accessible after they are declared.\n",
    "- `Re-assignable`: Variables declared with `let` can be reassigned new values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\*` Preferred Modern Choice`: `let` is the **preferred choice** for variable declaration in modern JavaScript due to its block scope and lack of hoisting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `const`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Block Scoped`: Like `let`, variables declared with `const` are block-scoped.\n",
    "- `No Hoisting`: Similar to `let`, `const` variables are not hoisted.\n",
    "- `Immutable`: Variables declared with `const` cannot be reassigned once they are initialized. However, this does not mean the value itself is immutable; if the value is an `object` or `array`, **its properties or elements can still be modified**.\n",

    "## Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In a JavaScript program, they are written as follows : `13`\n",
    "2. For **very big or very small numbers**, you may also use scientific notation by adding an `e` (for exponent), followed by the exponent of the number. `2.998e8`\n",
    "3. **Special numbers**: There are three special values in JavaScript that are considered `numbers` but don’t behave like normal `numbers`.\n",
    "   1. The first two are `Infinity` and `-Infinity`\n",
    "   2. Third is `NaN`, stands for “not a number”\n",
    "\n",
    "- JavaScript uses a fixed number of bits, **64 of them**, to store a single `number` value.\n",
    "- The important thing is to be aware of it and **treat fractional digital numbers as approximations**, not as precise values.\n"

    "`||` has the lowest precedence, then comes `&&`, then the comparison operators (`>`, `==`, and so on), and then the rest.\n",

    "   ```js\n",
    "   let p = true;\n",
