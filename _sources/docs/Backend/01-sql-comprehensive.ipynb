    "## Database normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "`Database normalization` is a process used to organize a relational database into tables and columns to **minimize `redundancy` and `dependency`**. It aims to reduce data anomalies such as insertion, update, and deletion anomalies, which can occur when data is not properly organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate normalization with a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a database to store information about `students` and the `courses` they are enrolled in. Initially, we might design a single table like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**StudentCourses Table:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| StudentID | StudentName | Course1   | Course2 | Course3   |\n",
    "| --------- | ----------- | --------- | ------- | --------- |\n",
    "| 1         | Alice       | Math      | Physics | Chemistry |\n",
    "| 2         | Bob         | Physics   | Biology |           |\n",
    "| 3         | Carol       | Chemistry |         |           |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this table, each row represents a `student`, and each column represents a `course` they are enrolled in. However, this table violates the principles of normalization because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Redundancy**: The **`course` names are repeated in multiple rows**, leading to redundancy.\n",
    "2. **Insertion Anomaly**: If a `student` wants to enroll in more `courses` than the available columns, we need to modify the table structure.\n",
    "3. **Deletion Anomaly**: If we delete a course from the database, we may lose information about which `students` were enrolled in that course.\n",
    "4. **Update Anomaly**: If we update the name of a `course`, we need to update it in multiple places, which can lead to inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "To normalize this database, we can break it down into multiple tables. We'll create separate tables for `Students` and `Courses` and introduce a linking table to represent the `many-to-many` relationship between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this normalized schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Students Table** stores information about `students`.\n",
    "- **Courses Table** stores information about `courses`.\n",

    "The `unique constraint` ensures that all values in a column are unique (i.e., **no duplicates are allowed**).\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be applied to one or more columns in a table. If a unique constraint is defined on multiple columns, the combination of values across those columns must be unique.\n",

    "CREATE TABLE Students (\n",
    "    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    StudentName VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,\n",
    "    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, both `StudentName` and `Email` columns have `unique constraints`, meaning that each student's name and email must be unique within the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "The `check constraint` is used to enforce a condition on the values allowed in a column. It ensures that all values `inserted` or `updated` in the column **satisfy the specified condition**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, the check constraints ensure that the `Age` column contains values greater than or equal to `18` and the `Department` column only contains values `IT`, `Finance`, or `HR`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "The `default constraint` specifies a default value for a column when no value is explicitly provided during an `insert` operation. If a `default constraint` is defined on a column, the default value is used if no other value is specified.\n",
    "\n",

    ");\n",
